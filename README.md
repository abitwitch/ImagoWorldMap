# ImagoWorldMap
Authagraphic inspired world map.

You may notice the map appears 'upsidedown'. This was a design choice.

# About the map:
* This map uses the 'Imago' projection (Justin Kunimune 2017) which was inspired by Hajime Narukawaâ€™s award-winning AuthaGraph design (1999).
* This map was built using the d3 javasctipt libraries. Source code can be found at: github.com/hua256/ImagoWorldMap
* Created by Josh Chisholm (2021)

# About the project:
* The index.html file should stand-alone and has no dependencies. All resources are linked directly within the document.
* The "Annotations.csv" is used for lableing of the map. 'index.html' points directly to the github repository.
* Made with Natural Earth. Free vector and raster map data @ naturalearthdata.com.
* ImagoMap.png is a high-res PNG of the resulting map
* ImagoMap_LowRes.jpg is a low-res JPG of the resulting map

# To install:
* Download index.html and load it in a web browser. (Developed with Chrome Version 68.0.3440.75).
* Note: it may take several minutes to load and draw all the data.
